<h3>A. Background</h3>
<p>In this modern world, we should laverage technologies in order to make our life easier. From using Calculator for computing mathematical operations, or weather app to see current weather forecast so that we prepared, to using Microsoft Excel to analyze and organize data, or even Artificial Intelligence to make us a step-by-step guide how to get a girlfriend. All of that using a device that we can access everywhere and anytime</p>
<p>It's fascinating to see how technology becomes more sophisticated. By laveraging technology, we can make our life easier. We don't have to worry about the mess of collecting assignments manually, we can also study anywhere and anytime without ever going to libraries, and if we miss somebody, we can just use online messaging apps to talk to them or even see their face using video calls</p>
<p>But, as technologies grows even further, people tend to make use of it. People that makes software usually has price for people to use the service. Yes, it makes sense that they want to have profits from it. But, I wonder.. What if we just make it for ourself? What we need are energy and time to do it! Of course we need some computational power and yes that absolutely needs some money but, it still better than we pay 300$ for only 50 voters! (we have approximately 4000 voters). So, that's why we created this website!</p>
<p>This website is created by IT Team in Mitra Industry Vocational High School in order to make voting system in School more transparent, easy to access, and efficient with low cost! We can use it to gather vote data across different campuses and visualize it in a nice admin dashboard! It straightforward but, can be analyzed even deeper with comprehensive data!</p>

<h3>B. Technology Used</h3>
<p>This website was made using some technologies that are I think it's effective to handle each features that our website have. We make sure to make it as performant as possible and can handle hundreds if not thousands of requests in a short span of time, our app should be secure and transparent as well! But, in order to achieve those features, we need modern technology that offer solutions for those problems!</p>
